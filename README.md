An GO module allowing calls to Rust code code with Apache Arrow data. Operate in either one-shot mode or IPC streaming.  
An example application in need of this is Thund , An Go/Rust based Apache Arrow centric DAG executor

Alloy means a mixture between two or more components and is a joint venture between Wilhelm Ã…gren (Rust)  and Rickard Lundin(GO).

## Usage example
The example main.go should envision how your GO application utilize Alloy.

```golang
func main() {
	mem := memory.NewGoAllocator()

	var b api.Bridge
	b = rust.Bridge{api.CommonParameter{mem}}

	values := [][]int32{
		{1, 2, 3, -4},
		{2, 3, 4, 5},
		{3, 4, 5, 6},
	}

	builders, arrays := buildAndAppend(mem, values)

	ret, err := b.FromChunks(arrays)

	if nil != err {
		fmt.Println(err)
	} else {
		rust.Info(fmt.Sprintf("Rust counted %v arrays sent through ffi", ret))
	}
}
```

Output, where default dummy Rust backend echoes out the sent data. It will be up to the Rust guys to implent code to process the data to their hearts content !!
