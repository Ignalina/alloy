An GO module allowing calls to Rust code code with Apache Arrow data. Operate in either one-shot mode or IPC streaming.  
An example application in need of this is Thund , An Go/Rust based Apache Arrow centric DAG executor

Alloy means a mixture between two or more components and is a joint venture between Wilhelm Ã…gren (Rust)  and Rickard Lundin(GO).

## Usage example
The example main.go should envision how your GO application utilize Alloy.

```golang
func main() {
    mem := memory.NewGoAllocator()
    values := [][]int32{
        {1, 2, 3, -4},
        {2, 3, 4, 5},
        {3, 4, 5, 6},
    }

    builders, arrays := buildAndAppend(mem, values)
    
	....
		
    goBridge := api.GoBridge{GoAllocator: mem}
    ret, err := goBridge.FromChunks(arrays)

    api.Info(fmt.Sprintf("Rust counted %v arrays sent through ffi", ret))
}

```

Output, where default dummy Rust backend echoes out the sent data. It will be up to the Rust guys to implent code to process the data to their hearts content !!
