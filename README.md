## ðŸ”Ž Overview
*alloy* is a **Go module that enables calls to Rust code with Apache Arrow datatypes**, and vice versa.

The overarching goal is to enable calls between languages through an underlying **C** interface, utilizing **cgo** and **Rust ffi**. 
This implementation comes with close to no overhead due to using the Apache Arrow data format. The only thing sent between the language binaries are raw data pointers referencing the allocated memory (in Arrow format). This allows for
fast, (somewhat) robust, and colorful use cases in data engineering scenarios.

Alloy means a mixture between two or more components and is (currently) a joint vernture between Rickard Ernst BjÃ¶rn Lundin (Go) and Wilhelm Ã…gren (Rust). If this project invokes interest in you, the reader, *feel free to contribute in any way or form*.
